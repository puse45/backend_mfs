### Development

You can install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to apply formatting on your code before it gets committed or pushed.

**NOTE:** pre-commit hooks require python3 to be installed.

Install `pre-commit` and its hooks (only need once):

    pip install pre-commit
    # to run checks on every 'git commit ...' install hooks via:
    pre-commit install

    # alternatively, to run checks on 'git push ...' only, use:
    pre-commit install -t pre-push

Afterwards pre-commit will run whenever you `git commit ...` or `git push ...`.


#### Run pipeline in dev, staging & production environments:
Push changes to develop, staging and production branches respectively
